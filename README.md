##  Automation of Complaint Categorization 

---

### Summary
This study explores the automation of complaint categorization in Indonesia’s national SP4N-LAPOR! system using traditional machine learning techniques (Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron) and modern deep learning methods (BERT). The data comprises over 73,000 verified citizen complaints, classified into 18 categories. Extensive pre-processing, feature engineering (TF-IDF), and model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) were conducted. Results show that while traditional methods perform reasonably well, BERT outperforms them with a 74% accuracy and 0.73 F1-score, particularly excelling in high-frequency complaint categories. The study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of automating text categorization to improve complaint management in e-government systems.
